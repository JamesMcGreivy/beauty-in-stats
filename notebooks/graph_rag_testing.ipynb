      "TreeRAG Answer: 1308.1707.tex: We present a measurement of form-factor independent angular observables in the decay \\mbox{$B^0\\to K^{*}(892)^{0}\\mu^+ \\mu^-$}. The analysis is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0fb$^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb experiment in $pp$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7TeV. Four observables are measured in six bins of the dimuon invariant mass squared, $q^2$, in the range $0.1<q^2<19.0$GeV$^{2}$/c$^{4}$. Agreement with Standard Model predictions is found for 23 of the 24 measurements. A local discrepancy, corresponding to $3.7$ Gaussian standard deviations, is observed in one $q^2$ bin for one of the observables. Considering the 24 measurements as independent, the probability to observe such a discrepancy, or larger, in one is $0.5\\%$.\n",

Effects due to {{B} ^0} /{{\\offsetoverline{B}} ^0} production asymmetry have been considered and found negligibly small. The comparison between the measurements and the theoretical predictions from Ref.~\\cite{Descotes-Genon:2013vna} are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:result:PResult} for the observables P_{4}^{'} and P_5^{'}. The observables P_{6}^{'} and P_{8}^{'} (as well as S_7 and S_8) are suppressed by the small size of the strong phase difference between the decay amplitudes, and therefore are expected to be close to zero across the whole q^2 region. In general, the measurements agree with SM expectations~\\cite{Descotes-Genon:2013vna}, apart from a sizeable discrepancy in the interval \\mbox{4.30<q^2<8.68 { { Ge \\kern -0.1em V} ^2 /c^4} } for the observable P_5^{'}. The p-value, calculated using pseudo-experiments, with respect to the upper bound of the theoretical predictions given in Ref.~\\cite{Descotes-Genon:2013vna}, for the observed deviation is 0.02\\%, corresponding to 3.7 Gaussian standard deviations (\\sigma). If we consider the 24 measurements as independent, the probability that at least one varies from the expected value by 3.7 \\sigma or more is approximately 0.5\\%. A discrepancy of 2.5 \\sigma is observed integrating over the region \\mbox{1.0<q^2<6.0 { { Ge \\kern -0.1em V} ^2 /c^4} } (see Table~\\ref{tab:results}), which is considered the most robust region for theoretical predictions at large recoil. The discrepancy is also observed in the observable S_5. The value of S_5 quantifies the asymmetry between decays with positive and negative value of \\cos{\\theta_K} for |\\phi|<\n",

As a cross check, this asymmetry was also determined from a counting analysis. The result is consistent with the value for S_{5} determined from the fit. It is worth noting that the predictions for the first two q^2-bins and for the region \\mbox{1.0<q^2<6.0 { { Ge \\kern -0.1em V} ^2 /c^4} } are also calculated in Ref.~\\cite{Jager:2012uw}, where power corrections to the QCD factorization framework and resonance contributions are considered. However, there is not yet in the literature unanimous consensus about the best approach to treat these power corrections. The technique used in Ref.~\\cite{Jager:2012uw} leads to a larger theoretical uncertainty with respect to Ref.~\\cite{Descotes-Genon:2013vna}. In conclusion, we measure for the first time the angular observables S_4, S_5, S_7, S_8 and the corresponding form-factor independent observables P_{4}^{'}, P_5^{'}, P_6^{'} and P_8^{'} in the decay {{{B} ^0} {\\to} {{K} ^{*0}} { {\\mu} ^+} { {\\mu} ^-} } .

      "\t\t\tChunk 4: these backgrounds are neglected in the angular analysis and are considered only as sources of systematic uncertainty. For every q^2 bin, a fit is performed in both the standard and the optimised basis. For each basis, four data sets are fit simultaneously: the {m({{K} ^+} {{\\pi} ^-} { {\\mu} ^+ {\\mu} ^-} )} and angular distributions of candidates in the Run~1 data; the equivalent distributions for the 2016 data; and the {m({{K} ^+} {{\\pi} ^-} )} distributions of candidates in the Run~1 and the 2016 data sets. The signal fraction is shared between the two data sets from each data-taking period. The {C P} -averaged angular observables and the S-wave fraction are shared between all data sets. The fitted probability density functions ({\\cal{P}}s) are of an identical form to those of Ref.~\\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2015-051}, as are the {q^2} bins used. In addition to the narrow {q^2} bins, results are obtained for the wider bins \\mbox{1.1 < {q^2} < 6.0 { { Ge \\kern -0.1em V} ^2 /c^4} } and \\mbox{15.0 < {q^2} < 19.0 { { Ge \\kern -0.1em V} ^2 /c^4} }.

Pseudoexperiments, generated using the results of the best fit to data, are used to assess the bias and coverage of the fit. The majority of observables have a bias of less than 10\\% of their statistical uncertainty, with the largest bias being 17\\%, and all observables have an uncertainty estimate within 10\\% of the true uncertainty. The biases are driven by boundary effects in the observables. The largest effect comes from requiring that F_{\\rm S}\\geq 0, which can bias F_{\\rm S} to larger values. This can then result in a bias in the P-wave observables (see Eq.~\\ref{eq:pdfswave}). The statistical uncertainty is corrected to account for any under- or over-coverage and a systematic uncertainty equal to the size of the observed bias is assigned. The size of other sources of systematic uncertainty is estimated using pseudoexperiments, in which one or more parameters are varied and the angular observables are determined with and without this variation. The systematic uncertainty is then taken as the difference between the two models. The pseudoexperiments are generated with signal yields many times larger than the data, in order to render statistical fluctuations negligible. The size of the total systematic uncertainty varies depending on the angular observable and the {q^2} bin. The majority of observables in both the S_{i} and P^{(')}_{i} basis have a total systematic uncertainty between 5\\% and 25\\% of the statistical uncertainty. For F_{\\rm L}, the systematic uncertainty tends to be larger, typically between 20\\% and 50\\%. The systematic uncertainties are given in Table~\\ref{tab:systematics} of the Supplemental Material.

      "\t\t\tChunk 2: for the narrow {q^2} bins, from the uncertainty associated with evaluating the acceptance at a fixed point in {q^2} . For the peaking backgrounds, the systematic uncertainty is evaluated by injecting additional candidates, drawn from the angular distributions of the background modes, into the pseudoexperiment data. The systematic uncertainty for the bias correction is determined directly from the pseudoexperiments used to validate the fit. The systematic uncertainty from the variation of the acceptance with {q^2} is determined by moving the point in {q^2} at which the acceptance is evaluated to halfway between the bin centre and the upper or the lower edge. The largest deviation is taken as the systematic uncertainty. Examples of further sources of systematic uncertainty investigated include the {m({{K} ^+} {{\\pi} ^-} )} lineshape for the S-wave contribution, the assumption that the acceptance function is flat across the m({{K} ^+} {{\\pi} ^-} ) mass, the effect of the {{{B} ^+} {\\to} {{K} ^+} { {\\mu} ^+} { {\\mu} ^-} } veto on the angular distribution of the background and the order of polynomial used for the background parameterisation. These sources make a negligible contribution to the total uncertainty. With respect to the analysis of Ref.~\\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2015-051}, the systematic uncertainty from residual differences between data and simulation is significantly reduced, owing to an improved decay model for {{{B} ^0} {\\to} { {J} / {\\psi} } {{K} ^{*0}} } decays~\\cite{Chilikin:2014bkk}.
