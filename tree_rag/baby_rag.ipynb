The ratio of the B-flavour averaged decay rates in D decays to CP and non-CP eigenstates is measured to be R_d_KK = 1.36 (+0.37) (-0.32) +- 0.07, where the ratio of the branching fractions of D0 -> K- pi+ to D0 -> K+ K- decays is included as multiplicative factor. The CP asymmetries measured with two control channels, the favoured B0 -> DK*0 decay with D -> K+ pi- and the Bs0bar -> D K*0 decay with D K+ K-, are also reported.',\n",
       "   'The time-integrated $CP$ asymmetry in the decay $D^0 \\\\to K^0_S K^0_S$ is measured using $3 fb^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The flavour of the $D^0$ meson is determined by use of the decay $D^{*+} \\\\to D^0 \\\\pi^+$ and its charge conjugate mode. The result is \\\\[ {\\\\cal A}_{CP} = -0.029 \\\\pm 0.052 \\\\pm 0.022, \\\\] where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. The result is consistent with Standard Model expectations and improves the uncertainty with respect to the only previous measurement of this quantity by more than a factor of three.',\n",
       "   'Measurements of $C\\\\!P$ observables in $B^\\\\pm \\\\rightarrow D K^\\\\pm$ and $B^\\\\pm \\\\rightarrow D \\\\pi^\\\\pm$ decays are presented where the $D$ meson is reconstructed in the final states $K^\\\\pm\\\\pi^\\\\mp$, $\\\\pi^\\\\pm K^\\\\mp$, $K^+K^-$, $\\\\pi^+\\\\pi^-$, $K^\\\\pm\\\\pi^\\\\mp \\\\pi^+ \\\\pi^-$, $\\\\pi^\\\\pm K^\\\\mp \\\\pi^+ \\\\pi^-$ and $\\\\pi^+ \\\\pi^- \\\\pi^+ \\\\pi^-$. This analysis uses a sample of charged $B$ mesons from $pp$ collisions collected by the LHCb experiment in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb$^{-1}$. Various \\\\CP-violating effects are reported and together these measurements provide important input for the determination of the unitarity triangle angle $\\\\gamma$. The analysis of the four-pion $D$ decay mode is the first of its kind.']],\n",

An amplitude analysis is performed on the three-body final-state that reproduces the two-body mass and angular distributions. To obtain a satisfactory fit of the structures seen in the $J/\\\\psi p$ mass spectrum, it is necessary to include two Breit-Wigner amplitudes that each describe a resonant state. The significance of each of these resonances is more than 9 standard deviations. One has a mass of $4380\\\\pm 8\\\\pm 29$ MeV and a width of $205\\\\pm 18\\\\pm 86$ MeV, while the second is narrower, with a mass of $4449.8\\\\pm 1.7\\\\pm 2.5$ MeV and a width of $39\\\\pm 5\\\\pm 19$ MeV.

It is shown that the design criteria of the experiment have been met. The excellent performance of the detector has allowed the LHCb collaboration to publish a wide range of physics results, demonstrating LHCb's unique role, both as a heavy flavour experiment and as a general purpose detector in the forward region.\",\n",

LHCb has applied two methods to determine the absolute scale of its luminosity measurements for proton-proton collisions at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. In addition to the classic 'van der Meer scan' method a novel technique has been developed which makes use of direct imaging of the individual beams using beam-gas and beam-beam interactions. This beam imaging method is made possible by the high resolution of the LHCb vertex detector and the close proximity of the detector to the beams, and allows beam parameters such as positions, angles and widths to be determined. The results of the two methods have comparable precision and are in good agreement. Combining the two methods, an overal precision of 3.5% in the absolute luminosity determination is reached.
