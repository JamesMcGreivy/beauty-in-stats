      " The dominant systematic uncertainties in measurements of the B⁰ mixing frequency (Δm_d) are primarily related to the modeling and fit procedures of the signal and decay-time distributions. Key sources include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Signal model and fit procedure uncertainties**: These arise from choices of signal shapes (mass and decay time resolution PDFs), fit biases, alternative modeling methods, and neglect of correlations among observables. Typical magnitudes are around 0.39 times the statistical uncertainty (in units of statistical standard deviations) [1304.4741, 1712.07051, 2011.12041].\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Decay-time acceptance, efficiency, resolution, and related modeling uncertainties**: These cover detailed effects in decay-time-dependent analyses such as acceptance modeling, lifetime biases, resolution calibration, and background decay-time distributions. They are typically about 1.00 times the statistical uncertainty, making them a leading systematic contribution [1610.05187, 1207.5993, 2011.12041].\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mass and momentum scale calibration uncertainties**: External uncertainties from detector calibration, magnetic field knowledge, and alignment affect mass and mass difference measurements, with typical magnitudes on the order of 122 keV/c² for B meson masses [1112.4896, 2011.01867].\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional important but somewhat smaller contributions include uncertainties from background modeling (about 0.18 in statistical units), lifetime and flight distance effects (~0.44), and various detector-related effects such as particle identification efficiency, trigger efficiency, and acceptance modeling. These typically have magnitudes ranging from a few percent to a few per mille in relative terms or fractions of the statistical uncertainty [2011.12041, 1605.09768, 1112.3056].\n",
      "\n",
      "The results do not explicitly separate Δm_d from Δm_s uncertainties, but given the close relation and the observable names mostly referencing B_s^0 oscillation frequency, the dominant systematic categories and their magnitudes are expected to be similar for Δm_d measurements. Typical magnitudes for the leading systematics are on the order of 0.4–1.0 times the statistical uncertainty, with decay-time modeling and signal fit procedure uncertainties being the most significant [2011.12041, 1610.05187].\n",
      "\n",
      "No direct numerical breakdown specific solely to Δm_d was found in the results, but the comprehensive descriptions and magnitudes for related neutral B meson mixing frequency measurements provide a clear picture of the dominant systematic sources and their typical sizes.\n"
