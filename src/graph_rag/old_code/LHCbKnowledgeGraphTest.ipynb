      "The systematic effect due to the choice of the invariant-mass fit model is assessed by means of pseudoexperiments wherein the invariant-mass distribution is generated with an alternative model and fitted using the baseline model. The alternative model replaces the two Crystal Ball functions by an Hypatia function (or vice versa for the {{{\\Lambda} ^0_{ b } } {\\to} { J / {\\psi} } {\\Lambda} } case) for the signal. The physical backgrounds in the {{{\\Lambda} ^0_{ b } } {\\to} { J / {\\psi} } {\\Lambda} } channel are both modelled with a single Crystal Ball function in the alternative model. \n",
      "The uncertainty on the selection efficiencies originating from the limited size of the simulated samples is propagated to the branching fraction and considered as a systematic uncertainty. \n",
      "The corrections applied to the simulation to improve the agreement with data are obtained with an uncertainty. The effect of this limited precision is assessed by varying the corrections within their uncertainty and recomputing the efficiencies 100 times. The standard deviation of the efficiency variation is assigned as a systematic uncertainty.\n",
      "The {\\chi^2} distribution of each kinematic fit is corrected using the normalisation channels as calibration samples. While the normalisation decay topology is similar, it is not identical to the signal decay.\n",
      "Alternative corrections for the simulations are derived by swapping the calibration channel, { i.e.} using the {{{\\Lambda} ^0_{ b } } {\\to} { J / {\\psi} } {\\Lambda} } channel for {{{\\Xi} ^0_{ b } } {\\to} { J / {\\psi} } {{\\Xi} ^-} {{\\pi} ^+} } corrections and the {{{\\Xi} ^-_{ b } } {\\to} { J / {\\psi} } {{\\Xi} ^-} } channel for {{{\\Lambda} ^0_{ b } } {\\to} { J / {\\psi} } {{\\Xi} ^-} {{ K } ^+} } corrections. The variation in the efficiency is assigned as the systematic uncertainty.\n",
      "After applying the baseline corrections to the simulation, some level of mismodelling remains in variables not used directly in the selection. The effect of this mismodelling is assessed by recomputing the efficiencies after correcting the additional distributions and the difference with respect to the baseline efficiency is added as a systematic uncertainty.\n",
      "The signal channels feature a prompt hadron without a counterpart in the normalisation channel. An additional uncertainty on tracking efficiency of 1.4 \\Efficiencies are determined from simulated samples and rely on an accurate match between generated and reconstructed decays. In some cases, this so-called truth matching can fail if the fraction of hits associated between the reconstructed track and the generated particle does not reach a minimum threshold. The effect of such potential incorrect matching is evaluated by recomputing the efficiencies with an alternative method that does not rely on truth matching. Instead, the number of signal events after the selection, required to compute the efficiency, is determined by an invariant-mass fit of the { b } -hadron spectrum, similar to the approach used for data. The difference in efficiency derived from the baseline and the alternative method is assigned as the systematic uncertainty.\n",
      "Lastly, inaccuracies in the phase-space model used for signal simulation could affect the derived efficiency. The decay dynamics and angular distributions are corrected using the signal channels. The effect of the limited precision on the derived corrections is assessed by recalculating 100 times the efficiencies after varying the correction factors within their statistical uncertainty. The standard deviation is assigned as the systematic uncertainty.\n",
