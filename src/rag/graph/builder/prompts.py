You are a research scientist in the LHCb collaboration at CERN and a particle physics expert. You will be given an abstract from an LHCb analysis paper and extract the information described below.

1. "run"
Identify the LHCb data-taking period or dataset characteristics
- "run1": Data collected during 2011-2012 at center-of-mass energies of 7-8 TeV
- "run2": Data collected during 2015-2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV
- "run1,run2": Combined dataset from both Run 1 and Run 2 periods (2011-2018)
- "run3": Data collected during 2022-2025 at a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV
- "ift": Any paper which does not use p-p as its production method.

2. "strategy"
Identify which of following labels best describes the analysis strategy employed in the paper.

- "angular_analysis": Studies that examine angular distributions or asymmetries in particle decays. These include forward-backward asymmetries, angular coefficients, or observables related to Wilson coefficients. These analyses typically perform multi-dimensional fits to angular variables to extract physics parameters and test Standard Model predictions.

- "amplitude_analysis": Studies focused on decay amplitude structures, including Dalitz plot analyses, determination of resonance properties, spin-parity assignments, or relative phase measurements. These analyses model interfering amplitudes and extract quantities such as fit fractions, strong phases, or resonance parameters.
        
- "search": Analyses aimed at discovering previously unobserved states, processes, or symmetry-breaking effects. This includes first observations of rare decay modes, searches for new particles, or forbidden processes. Often results in significance measurements for new signals or limit setting at confidence levels (typically 90% or 95%) when no significant signal is observed.
        
- "other": Any analysis that does not fall into the above three categories. This includes analyses primarily focused on precision measurements of established quantities, such as branching fraction determinations, lifetime measurements, production cross-sections, mass measurements.

3. "decay"
Identify all particle decay channels. For each decay channel, provide the production method, parent particle(s), and children particle(s). If the production, parent, or children of a decay is unknown then assign it the empty string "". You must select production methods and particles from the following lists:
- production: p-p, Pb-Pb, p-Pb, Xe-Xe, O-O, Pb-Ar, p-O
- particles: d, d~, u, u~, s, s~, c, c~, b, b~, t, t~, e-, e+, nu(e), nu(e)~, mu-, mu+, nu(mu), nu(mu)~, tau-, tau+, nu(tau), nu(tau)~, g, gamma, Z0, W+, W-, H0, R0, R~0, X(u)0, X(u)+, X(u)-, pi0, rho0, a0, K(L)0, B(L)0, pi+, pi-, rho+, rho-, a+, a-, eta, omega, f, K(S)0, K0, K~0, K*0, K*~0, K+, K-, K*+, K*-, eta', phi, f', B(sL)0, D+, D-, D*+, D*-, D0, D~0, D*0, D*~0, D(s)+, D(s)-, D(s)*+, D(s)*-, D(s2)*+, D(s2)*-, eta(c)(1S), J/psi(1S), chi(c2)(1P), B(H)0, B0, B~0, B*0, B*~0, B+, B-, B*+, B*-, B(sH)0, B(s)0, B(s)~0, B(s)*0, B(s)*~0, B(s2)*0, B(s2)*~0, B(c)+, B(c)-, B(c)*+, B(c)*-, B(c2)*+, B(c2)*-, eta(b)(1S), Upsilon(1S), chi(b2)(1P), Upsilon(1D), (dd), (dd)~, Delta-, Delta~+, Delta0, Delta~0, N0, N~0, (ud), (ud)~, n, n~, Delta+, Delta~-, N+, N~-, (uu), (uu)~, p, p~, Delta++, Delta~--, (sd), (sd)~, Sigma-, Sigma~+, Lambda, Lambda~, (su), (su)~, Sigma0, Sigma~0, Sigma+, Sigma~-, (ss), (ss)~, Xi-, Xi~+, Xi0, Xi~0, Omega-, Omega~+, (cd), (cd)~, Sigma(c)0, Sigma(c)~0, Lambda(c)+, Lambda(c)~-, Xi(c)0, Xi(c)~0, (cu), (cu)~, Sigma(c)+, Sigma(c)~-, Sigma(c)++, Sigma(c)~--, Xi(c)+, Xi(c)~-, (cs), (cs)~, Xi(c)'0, Xi(c)'~0, Xi(c)'+, Xi(c)'~-, Omega(c)0, Omega(c)~0, (cc), (cc)~, Xi(cc)+, Xi(cc)~-, Xi(cc)*+, Xi(cc)*~-, Xi(cc)++, Xi(cc)~--, Xi(cc)*++, Xi(cc)*~--, Omega(cc)+, Omega(cc)~-, Omega(cc)*+, Omega(cc)*~-, Omega(ccc)*++, Omega(ccc)*~--, (bd), (bd)~, Sigma(b)-, Sigma(b)~+, Sigma(b)*-, Sigma(b)*~+, Lambda(b)0, Lambda(b)~0, Xi(b)-, Xi(b)~+, Xi(bc)0, Xi(bc)~0, (bu), (bu)~, Sigma(b)0, Sigma(b)~0, Sigma(b)*0, Sigma(b)*~0, Sigma(b)+, Sigma(b)~-, Sigma(b)*+, Sigma(b)*~-, Xi(b)0, Xi(b)~0, Xi(bc)+, Xi(bc)~-, (bs), (bs)~, Xi(b)'-, Xi(b)'~+, Xi(b)*-, Xi(b)*~+, Xi(b)'0, Xi(b)'~0, Xi(b)*0, Xi(b)*~0, Omega(b)-, Omega(b)~+, Omega(b)*-, Omega(b)*~+, Omega(bc)0, Omega(bc)~0, (bc), (bc)~, Xi(bc)'0, Xi(bc)'~0, Xi(bc)*0, Xi(bc)*~0, Xi(bc)'+, Xi(bc)'~-, Xi(bc)*+, Xi(bc)*~-, Omega(bc)'0, Omega(bc)'~0, Omega(bc)*0, Omega(bc)*~0, Omega(bcc)+, Omega(bcc)~-, Omega(bcc)*+, Omega(bcc)*~-, (bb), (bb)~, Xi(bb)-, Xi(bb)~+, Xi(bb)*-, Xi(bb)*~+, Xi(bb)0, Xi(bb)~0, Xi(bb)*0, Xi(bb)*~0, Omega(bb)-, Omega(bb)~+, Omega(bb)*-, Omega(bb)*~+, Omega(bbc)0, Omega(bbc)~0, Omega(bbc)*0, Omega(bbc)*~0, Omega(bbb)-, Omega(bbb)~+, vpho, b0, b+, b-, h, D(s0)*+, D(s0)*-, D(s1)+, D(s1)-, chi(c0)(1P), h(c)(1P), B(s0)*0, B(s0)*~0, B(s1)(L)0, B(s1)(L)~0, B(c0)*+, B(c0)*-, B(c1)(L)+, B(c1)(L)-, chi(b0)(1P), h(b)(1P), eta(b2)(1D), D(H)+, D(H)-, chi(c1)(1P), B(H)~0, B(H)+, B(H)-, B(s1)(H)0, B(s1)(H)~0, B(c1)(H)+, B(c1)(H)-, chi(b1)(1P), X(sd), X(sd)~, X(su), X(su)~, X(ss), X(ss)~, psi, Upsilon_1(1D), D(2S)+, D(2S)-, D(2S)0, D(2S)~0, eta(c)(2S), psi(2S), chi(c2), eta(b)(2S), Upsilon(2S), chi(b2)(2P), Upsilon(2D), chi(b0)(2P), h(b)(2P), eta(b2)(2D), chi(b1)(2P), eta(b)(3S), Upsilon(3S), chi(b2)(3P), chi_b0(3P), h_b(3P), chi_b1(3P), Upsilon(4S), pi(tc)0, rho(tc)0, pi(tc)+, pi(tc)-, rho(tc)+, rho(tc)-, pi(tc)'0, omega(tc), nu(e)*0, nu(e)*~0, pi, f(J), Upsilon, rho, Z+, Z-, X

You may need to use your knowledge as a particle physics expert when classifying. For a paper that "measures B_s \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^- and B_0 -> \\mu^+ \\mu^- in pp collisions" the "B_s" would be written as "B(s)0" because B_s (strange B-meson) corresponds to B(s)0 in the provided list of allowed particles.

4. "observable"
Identify all physical quantities being directly measured or derived from experimental data in the current analysis. 

Examples: CKM mixing angles, branching fractions, CP violation parameters, differential cross-sections, particle masses, particle lifetimes

Important:
- Exclude broad physics motivations like lepton universality or matter-antimatter asymmetry.
- If it is not mentioned in the abstract, it is less likely to fit the definition of observable.
- Do not duplicate observables. Create only one entity per observable, regardless of how many kinematic bins it has. If the paper measures a branching fraction ratio then you should NOT make separate observables for the numerator and denominator in the ratio.

Categories:
- "branching_fraction": Explicitly called branching fractions (e.g., B(B^- -> D^0\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-))
- "branching_ratio": Ratio of branching fractions (e.g., B(B_s^0-bar -> D_s^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-) / B(B_s^0-bar -> D_s^+\\pi^-)) where both numerator and denominator were measured in this analysis.
- "physical_constant": Fundamental physics parameters (e.g., CP-violating phase Î³, CKM angles, wilson coefficients, particle lifetimes)
- "angular_observable": From angular analyses (e.g., asymmetries in angular distributions, polarization fractions, helicity amplitudes)
- "functional_dependence": Measured as functions of kinematic variables (e.g., p_T distributions, differential cross sections vs rapidity, form factors vs q^2)

"relationship_measured_with":
Identify when an "observable" is being measured in the analysis by studying the properties of a "decay" process.

Branching fractions of the decays $H_b\\to H_c\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ relative to $H_b\\to H_c\\pi^-$ are presented, where $H_b$ ($H_c$) represents B^0-bar($D^+$), $B^-$ ($D^0$), B_s^0-bar ($D_s^+$) and $\\Lambda_b^0$ ($\\Lambda_c^+$). The measurements are performed with the LHCb detector using 35${{\\rm pb^{{-1}}}}$ of data collected at $\\sqrt{{s}}=7$ TeV. The ratios of branching fractions are measured to be B(B^0-bar -> D^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-)/ B(B^0-bar -> D^+\\pi^-) = 2.38\\pm0.11\\pm0.21 B(B^- -> D^0\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-) / B(B^- -> D^0\\pi^-) = 1.27\\pm0.06\\pm0.11 B(B_s^0-bar -> D_s^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-) / B(B_s^0-bar -> D_s^+\\pi^-) = 2.01\\pm0.37\\pm0.20 B(\\Lambda_b^0->\\Lambda_c^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-) / B(\\Lambda_b^0 -> \\Lambda_c^+\\pi^-) = 1.43\\pm0.16\\pm0.13. We also report measurements of partial decay rates of these decays to excited charm hadrons. These results are of comparable or higher precision than existing measurements.

Paper:

Branching fractions of the decays $H_b\\to H_c\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ relative to $H_b\\to H_c\\pi^-$ are presented, where $H_b$ ($H_c$) represents B^0-bar($D^+$), $B^-$ ($D^0$), B_s^0-bar ($D_s^+$) and $\\Lambda_b^0$ ($\\Lambda_c^+$). The measurements are performed with the LHCb detector using 35${{\\rm pb^{{-1}}}}$ of data collected at $\\sqrt{{s}}=7$ TeV. The ratios of branching fractions are measured to be B(B^0-bar -> D^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-)/ B(B^0-bar -> D^+\\pi^-) = 2.38\\pm0.11\\pm0.21 B(B^- -> D^0\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-) / B(B^- -> D^0\\pi^-) = 1.27\\pm0.06\\pm0.11 B(B_s^0-bar -> D_s^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-) / B(B_s^0-bar -> D_s^+\\pi^-) = 2.01\\pm0.37\\pm0.20 B(\\Lambda_b^0->\\Lambda_c^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-) / B(\\Lambda_b^0 -> \\Lambda_c^+\\pi^-) = 1.43\\pm0.16\\pm0.13. We also report measurements of partial decay rates of these decays to excited charm hadrons. These results are of comparable or higher precision than existing measurements.

Several sources contribute uncertainty to the measured ratios of branching fractions. Because
we are measuring ratios of branching fractions, most, but not all of the potential systematics cancel.
Here, we discuss only the non-cancelling uncertainties. With regard to the reconstruction
of the H_b \to H_c \pi^-\pi^+\pi^- and H_b \to H_c \pi^- decays, the former has two additional pions which need to
pass our selections, and the 3\pi system needs to pass the various vertex-related selection criteria.
The track reconstruction efficiency and uncertainty are evaluated by measuring the ratio of 
fully reconstructed J/\psi's to all J/\psi's obtained from an inclusive single muon trigger,
where only one of the muons is required to be reconstructed.
After reweighting the efficiencies to match the kinematics of the signal tracks, the uncertainty is
found to be 2\fraction ratios. The IP resolution in data is about 20\to (i) a larger efficiency for tracks to pass the IP-related cuts (as well as larger background),
and (ii) a lower efficiency to pass the vertex \chi^2 selections, for data relative to the
value predicted by simulation. The first of these is studied by reducing the IP \chi^2 requirement
in simulation by 20\simulation until it agrees with data. The combined correction is found to be 1.02\pm0.03.
Another potential source of systematic uncertainty is related to the production and decay model for
producing the H_c\pi\pi\pi final state. We have considered that the p_T spectrum of the pions
in the 3\pi system may be different between simulation and data. To estimate the uncertainty, we reweight the
MC simulation to replicate the momentum spectrum of the lowest momentum pion (amongst the pions 
in the 3\pi vertex.) We find that the total efficiency
using the reweighted spectra agrees with the unweighted spectra to within 3\also investigated the effect of differences in the p_T spectra of the charm particle,
and find at most a 1\M(\pi\pi\pi)<3~GeV/c^2. Given that the 
phase space population approaches zero as M(\pi\pi\pi) \to 3.5~GeV/c^2 ( \it i.e., M_B-M_D)
and that the simulation reasonably reproduces the \pi^-\pi^+\pi^- mass spectrum, we
use the simulation to assess the fraction of the \pi\pi\pi mass spectrum beyond 3~GeV/c^2.
We find the fraction of events above 3~GeV/c^2 is (3.5-4.5)\We apply a correction of 1.04\pm0.02, where we have assigned half the correction as 
an estimate of the uncertainty. In total, the correction for production and decay models is 1.04\pm0.04.
As discussed in Sec.~\ref sec:recsel , we choose only one candidate per event. The efficiency of
this selection is estimated by comparing the signal yield in multiple-candidate events before and
after applying the best candidate selection. The selection is estimated to be (75\pm20)\In the H_b \to H_c \pi^-\pi^+\pi^- the multiple candidate rate varies from 4\so we have corrections that vary from 1.01 to 1.03. For H_b \to H_c \pi^-, this effect is negligible.
The corrections for each mode are given in Table~\ref tab:syst .
For the trigger efficiency, we rely on signal MC simulations to emulate the online trigger.
The stability of the relative trigger efficiency was checked by reweighting the b-hadron
p_T spectra for both the signal and normalization modes, and re-evaluating the trigger efficiency ratios. 
We find maximum differences of 2\(2.4\Fitting systematics are evaluated by varying the background shapes and assumptions about the signal
parameterization for both the H_b \to H_c \pi^-\pi^+\pi^- 
and H_b \to H_c \pi^- modes and re-measuring the yield ratios. For the combinatorial background,
using first and second order polynomials leads to a 3\Reflection background uncertainties are negligible, except for 
\kern 0.18em \overline \kern -0.18em B ^0_s \to D_s^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^- and \kern 0.18em \overline \kern -0.18em B ^0_s \to D_s^+\pi^-, where we find deviations as large as 5\the constraints on the \kern 0.18em \overline \kern -0.18em B ^0 \to D^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^- and \kern 0.18em \overline \kern -0.18em B ^0 \to D^+\pi^- reflections by \pm1 standard deviation.
We have checked our sensitivity to the signal model by varying the constraints on the width ratio and 
core Gaussian area fraction by one standard deviation (2\We also include a systematic uncertainty of 1\neglecting the small radiative tail in the fit, which is estimated by comparing the
yields between our double Gaussian signal model and the sum of a Gaussian and Crystal Ball~\cite cbal2 
line shape. Taken together, we assign a 4\the relative yields. For the \kern 0.18em \overline \kern -0.18em B ^0_s branching fraction ratio, the total fitting uncertainty is 6.4\Another difference between the H_b \to H_c \pi^- and H_b \to H_c \pi^-\pi^+\pi^- selection is the upper limit on the number of
tracks. The efficiencies of the lower track multiplicity requirements can be evaluated using the samples with higher track 
multiplicity requirements. Using this technique, we find corrections of 0.95\pm0.01 for the B^- and \Lambda_b^0 
branching fraction ratios, and 0.99\pm0.01 for the \kern 0.18em \overline \kern -0.18em B ^0 and \kern 0.18em \overline \kern -0.18em B ^0_s branching fraction ratios.
We have also studied the PID efficiency uncertainty using a D^ *+ calibration sample in data. Since
the PID requirements are either common to the signal and normalization modes, or in the case of the bachelor
pion(s), the selection is very loose, the uncertainty is small and we estimate a correction of 1.01\pm0.01. We have
also considered possible background from H_b \to H_c D_s^- which results in a correction of 0.99\pm0.01.
All of our MC samples have a comparable number of events, from which we incur 3-4\the efficiency ratio determinations. 
The full set of systematic uncertainties and corrections are shown in Table~\ref tab:syst .
In total, the systematic uncertainty is \sim9\\begin table* [ht]

# TASK
You have been given a cluster of {len(similar_entities)} potentially similar entities that were identified by an algorithmic clustering method. Your job is to make the final decision about which entities (if any) should actually be merged together.

# INSTRUCTIONS
- Carefully examine each entity's name, description, and attributes
- Decide which entities represent the exact same concepts and ONLY merge those.
- You can merge all entities into one, create multiple merged groups, or decide not to merge any entities at all.

# CRITICAL RULES
- NEVER change attribute names - keep them exactly as they appear. Include ALL attributes
- For "arxiv_id": combine, de-duplicate, and sort numerically as a comma-separated string.
- For other attributes: choose most representative value or create appropriate ranges/combinations
- "source_indices" is an integer list of the input indices for input entities that were merged to create the "merged_entity"

IMPORTANT: Provide ONLY the Python list in your response. Do not include any explanations, reasoning, or additional text before or after the list. Your entire response should be parseable as a Python list.
